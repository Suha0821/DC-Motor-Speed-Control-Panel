# 🔧 DC Motor Speed Control using PWM | Tinkercad Simulation

## 🎯 Objective:
Simulate a control panel system to control a DC motor's speed using Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) with Arduino in Tinkercad.

## 🔩 Components Used:
- Arduino Uno
- DC Motor (Simulated)
- Potentiometer (for speed control)
- Start/Stop Push Buttons
- LED (Running Indicator)

## 🧠 Logic:
- Press START ➜ Motor starts
- Turn Potentiometer ➜ Speed adjusts via PWM
- Press STOP ➜ Motor stops
- LED ON while motor is running

## 💡 Learning Outcomes:
- Understood PWM motor control using Arduino
- Simulated control panel logic with Start/Stop & indication
- Applied low-voltage panel design principles

## 🛠️ Tools Used:
- Arduino IDE
- Tinkercad Circuits
